## Introduction

As part of Transport Scotland's LATIS framework, there is a minimal acceptable set of data standards which must be followed by all survey companies participating in data collection activities.

This site provides these guidelines and links to relevant documentation and tools. While the main content of this site should remain relatively consistent, it should be considered as an actively-updated document and is subject to change. 

**Please note: this document is currently still a work in progress and as such is likely to be changed frequently**

## Sections
- [Data Formats](data_formats.md) covers the basic guidelines for data formatting, and should be read first.
- [Survey Types](survey_types/index.md) provides specific guidance according to the kind of transport survey to be undertaken.
