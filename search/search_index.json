This format allows for storage of metadata directly alongside the survey data itself, ensuring that this information is not lost, and is easily read by machines. As JSON is less \"human readable\", in certain circumstances it may be beneficial to provide the data in Excel or CSV formats. If this is the case, this information should only ever be provided in addition to the JSON files, with clear information provided to the recipient that the JSON files are the primary format. Basic Structure and Mandatory Fields \u00b6 The exact structure will vary according to the type of survey undertaken, however some fields are required across all survey types. Mandatory Metadata Fields \u00b6 Field Description Example survey_type The type of survey data contained in this file. Canonical list coming soon . ATC start_date The start date of the survey covered by this file, in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2019-11-01 end_date The end date of the survey covered by this file, in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2019-11-08 collected_by The survey company responsible for data collection. Tyrell Corporation incidents See below See below errors See below See below Incidents \u00b6 For the benefit of future users, any incidents occurring at or near the survey location which may have a material affect on the results must be included as part of the metadata for any and all relevant files. Incidents may include (but are not limited to): diversions accidents roadworks Required Fields for Incidents \u00b6 Any incidents should be provided as a list of items, with each item containing the following fields: Field Description Example start The date and time at which the incident will have first started to affect survey results, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format 2019-11-01 07:55 end The date and time from which the incident will no longer survey results, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format 2019-11-01 08:30 description A description of the incident Police road closure Should no incidents occur, this key should still be included within the metadata, with an empty array as its corresponding value. Errors \u00b6 Any instances of failures in automated data collection or gaps in surveys must be included as part of the metadata for any and all relevant files, with both broadly fitting into the category of \"errors\". Errors could include: malfunctioning equipment obstructed or incomplete (e.g. for queue surveys) views for video footage Required Fields for Errors \u00b6 Any incidents should be provided as a list of items, with each item containing the following fields: Field Description Example start The date and time at which the error will have first started to affect survey results, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format 2019-11-01 07:55 end The date and time from which the error will no longer survey results, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format 2019-11-01 08:30 description A description of the incident Camera obstructed by owl As with incidents, should no errors occur, this key should still be included within the metadata, with an empty array as its corresponding value. Categorising Incidents and Errors \u00b6 The definitions of \"incidents\" and \"errors\" are broadly similar. As a rule of thumb, something should be classified as an incident if the actual collection of data has not been impacted but the data itself may have been. An error, on the other hand, broadly refers to anything that has prevented collection of data. Example \u00b6 No incidents / errors { \"metadata\" : { \"survey_type\" : \"ANPR\" , \"collected_by\" : \"Tyrell Corporation\" , \"start_date\" : \"2019-11-01\" , \"end_date\" : \"2019-11-08\" , \"incidents\" : [], \"errors\" : [] } } With incidents / errors { \"metadata\" : { \"survey_type\" : \"ANPR\" , \"collected_by\" : \"Tyrell Corporation\" , \"start_date\" : \"2019-11-01\" , \"end_date\" : \"2019-11-08\" , \"incidents\" : [ { \"start\" : \"2019-11-01 07:55\" , \"end\" : \"2019-11-01 08:30\" , \"description\" : \"Police road closure\" } ], \"errors\" : [ { \"start\" : \"2019-11-01 21:15\" , \"end\" : \"2019-11-01 23:45\" , \"description\" : \"Camera obstructed by owl\" }, { \"start\" : \"2019-11-02 06:00\" , \"end\" : \"2019-11-02 06:50\" , \"description\" : \"View obscured by excessive rain\" } ], } }","title":"Data formats"},{"location":"data_formats/#file-types","text":"The main storage format for survey data should be JSON.

Data Structure \u00b6 Data should be provided through use of a separate JSON file for each counter used in the survey. These files should be named in a manner such that it is easy to identify both the task order they relate to and the site that they each contain. Required Fields \u00b6 Metadata \u00b6 In addition to the mandatory fields detailed in the Data Formats page, there are three additional metadata fields required for every ATC site, each of which is detailed in the following sections. Field Description Example location A location object, with specified keys. See below directions An array containing the directions used in the count data, with specified keys. See below classifications An array containing the vehicle type classifications used in the count data, with specified keys. See below Location \u00b6 The location object for each ATC site should be sufficiently detailed for it to be accurately located either through mapping software or from its description alone. This information should provided according to the actual location used for the installation of the counter, in case this varies from the brief for any reason. Coordinates should be provided in British National Grid (EPSG:27700) form. Field Description Example description Text-based description of the counter location. Port Dundas Road, 50m South of junction with Milton St eastings x-coordinate of the counter location as installed . 259016 northings y-coordinate of the counter location as installed . 666122 Example \u00b6 { \"metadata\" : { \"location\" : { \"description\" : \"Port Dundas Road, 50m South of junction with Milton St\" , \"eastings\" : 259016 , \"northings\" : 666122 } } } Directions \u00b6 Each direction used in the data should be detailed within the metadata, with both the exact encoding used in the data and a description of the direction to validate this. Field Description Example direction Direction as used in the data. NB description Description of the direction of travel. Towards Milton Street Example \u00b6 { \"metadata\" : { \"directions\" : [ { \"direction\" : \"NB\" , \"description\" : \"Towards Milton Street\" }, { \"direction\" : \"SB\" , \"description\" : \"Towards Cowcaddens Road\" } ] } } Classifications \u00b6 The majority of ATC surveys require categorised vehicle counts. To avoid ambiguity, the categorisation methods used by the counter should be detailed as clearly as possible within this key. Field Description Example class Vehicle class as used in the data. 1 description Description of the class. Car Example \u00b6 { \"metadata\" : { \"classifications\" : [ { \"class\" : 1 , \"description\" : \"Car\" }, { \"class\" : 2 , \"description\" : \"LGV\" }, { \"class\" : 3 , \"description\" : \"HGV\" } ] } } Data \u00b6 Count data should be provided as an array with one entry per time period. Within this, the count should be specified for each direction and vehicle class. Field Description Example start The start of the time period being reported by this record, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. 2019-11-01 07:00 end The end of the time period being reported by this record, in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format. 2019-11-01 08:00 counts An array containing the observed counts, with specified keys. See below Counts \u00b6 The reported counts include descriptions which should directly match up to the values as provided in the metadata. It is also critical that observed counts of zero are included, and \"unobserved\" periods are not recorded as zero . The recipient of the data must be able to distinguish between gaps in the data (e.g. due to malfunctioning equipment) and actual periods with no observations. Field Description Example direction Direction of travel. Must match up with directions specified in the metadata NB class Vehicle class. Must match up with directions specified in the metadata 1 count Number of vehicles recorded under the given parameters. 15 Basic Checks \u00b6 Preparing the data \u00b6 Most checks should be undertaken through use of hourly totals, though it may also be beneficial to check data at shorter time intervals if collected. Tidality \u00b6 Vehicle counts, particularly in locations near to populous areas, can be very \"tidal\" - large flows in one direction in the morning, and then in the other direction in the evening. Where this occurs, the direction of flows should be checked to confirm that the directions reported are correct. Vehicle type proportions \u00b6 In most circumstances vehicle types relating to \"cars\" should provide the majority of flow at any given location. This is most prevalent during the daytime hours - at a minimum, any instance of \"non-car\" vehicle counts exceeding \"car\" vehicle counts for a one-hour period between 7am and 7pm (inclusive) should be investigated.
