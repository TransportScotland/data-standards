This format allows for storage of metadata directly alongside the survey data itself, ensuring that this information is not lost, and is easily read by machines. As JSON is less \"human readable\", in certain circumstances it may be beneficial to provide the data in Excel or CSV formats. If this is the case, this information should only ever be provided in addition to the JSON files, with clear information provided to the recipient that the JSON files are the primary format. Basic Structure and Mandatory Fields The exact structure will vary according to the type of survey undertaken, however some fields are required across all survey types. Mandatory Metadata Fields Field Description Example survey_type The type of survey data contained in this file. Canonical list coming soon . ATC start_date The start date of the survey covered by this file, in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2019-11-01 end_date The end date of the survey covered by this file, in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2019-11-08 collected_by The survey company responsible for data collection. Tyrell Corporation Incidents For the benefit of future users, any incidents occurring at or near the survey location which may have a material affect on the results must be included as part of the metadata for any and all relevant files. Failures / Gaps Any instances of failures in automated data collection or gaps in surveys must be included as part of the metadata for any and all relevant files.
